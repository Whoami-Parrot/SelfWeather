# SelfWeather
A very simple self-hosting app for the weather using OpenWeatherAPI.

*Note: The app has just started, soon it will be more advanced*

# How to use
* Get an API key from OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Clone the repostiory
* Open the index.html file
* Insert your API key (you will insert it on every launch)
* Search for your place (Country does not count. For example don't write "Greece" instead write a town/city like "Heraklion" or "Athens")
* Select the place
Done!
